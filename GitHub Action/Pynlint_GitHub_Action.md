# Pylint Configuration and Workflow Fix in Python Project

## Problem Statement
I faced an issue where my Python code was not properly rated due to PEP8 violations like missing module docstrings and incorrect naming conventions. Initially, the code was rated **5.00/10** by Pylint, indicating a need for improvement.

## Problem Encountered
When running Pylint in GitHub Actions, the code was rated poorly for the following reasons:
- Missing module docstrings.
- Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., not using snake_case for filenames).
- Missing function or method docstrings.

**Initial Output Example:**
```
************* Module Testing
Testing.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
Testing.py:1:0: C0103: Module name "Testing" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)
************* Module demoForHooks
demoForHooks.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
demoForHooks.py:1:0: C0103: Module name "demoForHooks" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)
demoForHooks.py:1:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)

Your code has been rated at 5.00/10
```

## Solution

By following the guidelines and ensuring compliance with PEP8 standards, I made the necessary changes to my code:
- Added module-level docstrings.
- Ensured that file and function names conformed to snake_case naming conventions.
- Updated the project with function-level docstrings.

### Changes Applied:
1. I used Pylint to scan the code and address all the issues.
2. I provided docstrings for each function and module.
3. Ensured that the naming conventions adhered to Python's PEP8 guidelines.

**Command Used to Scan the Python Files:**
```bash
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

## Results
After applying the changes, the code was re-analyzed, and the rating improved significantly, achieving **10.00/10**.

### Updated Output:
```
Analyzing the code with pylint
Your code has been rated at 10.00/10
```

## Pros of Using Pylint with GitHub Actions
- **Automated Code Quality Checks**: Pylint ensures that code quality is maintained across multiple branches and commits.
- **Catch Issues Early**: Catch common issues such as missing docstrings, improper naming conventions, and more, during the development process.
- **Continuous Feedback**: With GitHub Actions, you can receive immediate feedback on the code quality with every push or pull request.
