# Git Rebase and Secret Detection Issue

## Problem

While working on my **GIT-GITHUB-FOR-DEVOPS-WORKSHOP** repository, I encountered a problem with Git when trying to push my changes to GitHub. Specifically, I received an error related to GitHub's **secret scanning and push protection** feature, which prevented me from pushing my changes due to a detected **secret** in one of my commits.

### Error:

```
remote: 
remote:  __ GitHub Personal Access Token __
remote: 
remote: locations:
remote: - commit: 2c01af78ba361f65b8b13a711d048540bc9a7e04
remote:   path: Commands.txt:41
remote: 
remote: To push, remove the secret from commit(s) or follow this URL to allow the secret.
remote: https://github.com/NabeehaAliii/GIT-GITHUB-FOR-DEVOPS-WORKSHOP/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/xyz...
```

GitHub rejected the push due to the presence of a secret in the `Commands.txt` file in commit `2c01af7`.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identify the Commit Containing the Secret

The error message indicated the specific commit (`2c01af7`) that contained the secret. I confirmed the commit using:

```bash
git log
```

### Step 2: Interactive Rebase

To resolve the issue, I used Git’s interactive rebase to modify the history and remove the secret from the affected commit.

1. **Start an interactive rebase:**

   I targeted the fourth commit prior to the current `HEAD`, which contained the problematic changes. The command I used was:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i 2c01af78ba361f65b8b13a711d048540bc9a7e04~4
   ```

2. **Edit the commit**:  
   In the interactive editor, I changed the `pick` command to `edit` for the problematic commit:

   ```bash
   edit 2c01af7 Added Commands.txt
   ```

3. **Modify the commit**:  
   After the rebase paused at the desired commit, I edited the `Commands.txt` file to remove the sensitive information.

4. **Amend the commit**:  
   Once the secret was removed, I amended the commit:

   ```bash
   git commit --amend
   ```

5. **Continue the rebase**:  
   Finally, I continued the rebase process:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Step 3: Merge Conflict and Resolution

During the rebase process, a merge conflict was encountered in the `Commands.txt` file. To resolve this:

1. **Manual Merge Conflict Resolution**:  
   Git informed me that there was a conflict in the `Commands.txt` file. I resolved the conflict manually by editing the file and selecting the correct changes.

2. **Mark Conflict as Resolved**:  
   Once the conflict was resolved, I marked the changes as resolved using:

   ```bash
   git add Commands.txt
   ```

3. **Continue Rebase**:  
   After resolving the conflict, I continued the rebase process by running:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Skip Empty Commit (if necessary)**:  
   In case of any empty commits, I used the following command to skip them:

   ```bash
   git rebase --skip
   ```

### Step 4: Push the Changes

After successfully resolving the merge conflict and completing the rebase, I forced the push to GitHub since I had rewritten the Git history:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## Conclusion

By using Git’s interactive rebase, resolving merge conflicts, and amending the commit history, I was able to successfully remove sensitive information from the commit history and complete the push to GitHub without further issues.

This approach ensures that the secret is not visible in the Git history and resolves any push protection issues triggered by GitHub’s secret scanning mechanism.
